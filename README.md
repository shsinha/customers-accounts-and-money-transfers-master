# Microservices application: Customers, accounts and money transfers

This is the source code for a simple banking application.
The application architecture is based on [microservices](http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html), [Event Sourcing](http://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html) and [CQRS](http://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html).
It is built using Spring Cloud, Spring Boot and the [Eventuate platform](http://eventuate.io/).
The application is used in hands-on labs that are part of a [microservices services class](http://www.chrisrichardson.net/training.html) that is taught by [Chris Richardson](http://www.chrisrichardson.net/about.html).
